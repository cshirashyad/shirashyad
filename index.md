_Last updated: January 4, 2026_

## 1. Overview

GolfTracker is a simple score and shot-tracking app for personal use.  
This app is designed to store your data **locally on your device** and not to sell or share it with third parties.[3][1]

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Personal Information You Provide
- First name  
- Last name  
- Email address  
- Optional mobile phone number  

This information is entered by you and stored only on your device. It is used to personalize the app experience (for example, showing your name in screens) and to associate rounds and statistics with your profile. It is **not** sent to our servers because we do not operate any servers for this app.[2][3]

### 2.2 Usage Data

The app stores the following gameplay data locally:

- Course name and number of holes  
- Date and time of each round  
- Per-hole information such as par and counts of drives, long shots, approaches, chips, and putts  

This data is used only to show your history and statistics inside the app.[2][3]

## 3. Data Storage and Security

All data is stored locally on your device using Apple’s system storage technologies (for example, on-device databases). We do not receive or store your data on external servers.[1][3]

Please note that if you delete the app or reset your device, your data may be permanently lost.

## 4. Data Sharing

We do **not**:

- Sell your personal information  
- Share your data with advertisers or data brokers  
- Track you across other apps or websites  

We may use Apple-provided services such as crash reporting or analytics that are governed by Apple’s own privacy policies.[4][1]

## 5. Children’s Privacy

GolfTracker can be used by or for children under 13 only with the consent and supervision of a parent or guardian. The app does not collect more data than described in this policy.[5]

## 6. Your Choices

Within the app, you can:

- Delete individual rounds from your history  
- Permanently delete discarded rounds from local storage  

If you wish to remove all data, you can delete the app from your device.

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the “Last updated” date above and may update the description in the App Store listing.[2]
